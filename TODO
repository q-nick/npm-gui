new project initialization - later
standalone - electron app (probably without webserver)

commands:
npm dedupe - OK
npm init - later
npm prune - OK
npm shrinkwrap

additional:
npm star - later
npm unstar - later

Tests to confirm that CLI works as expected, example:

`npm ls --json` should list installed packages in json format and should contain...
`npm install npm-gui -S` should save package and save it in package.json
etc...


Modules:
- Show which are installed. - OK
- Show which are extraneous. - ?WHERE? - little red label on dedupe later - list in modal?
- Install All / Reinstall All - partial OK

NSP:
- better support for deep dependency
